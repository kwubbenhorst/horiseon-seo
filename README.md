# Horiseon SEO

## Description: 

Updates to the webpage of marketing agency, Horiseon, enhancing accessibility/SEO

This update for the client, Horiseon Social Solution Service, Inc. is aimed at optimizing both the representation of the page in search engine results, and the user experience given the diverse accessiblity needs of the company's potential customer base. As a marketing agency that offers search engine optimization services to other businesses and even embeds the acryonym SEO in the Horiseon name, the company felt it was imperative to display on its own web interface the same protocols for search engine optimization it recommends and implements for its clients.  

In dialog with the company's tech lead, it was agreed the webpage update would to focus on enhancements in 5 areas: 1. I would refactor the code so that the HTML was more transparent as to its meaning, in keeping with the evolution of HTML 5 from earlier standards, 2. The page would follow an elegant sequential flow of structural logic independent of styling.  All image content would be reconfigured so the images would be intelligible to an electronic e-reader.     All HTML elements in the source code are semantic. The size of headings follow a diminishing hierarchy throughout the page, for the same reasons of accessibility to e-readers.  And the page's title be concise and descriptive.  These goal were achieved by ensuring semantic HTML elements and extensive commenting throughout, and using shorthand and nesting of attributes to streamline and logically sequence the code.  Alt attributes were added to image content and some use was made of the aria attributes (tags for accessibility rich internet applications). One adjustment was made in the footer to conform the heading flow to the diminishing hierarchy for headings. I considered that the page's title is not only what web developers officially call the Title, in the HTML head, but the visible title (Horiseon) which appears in the page's header.  A higher contrast colour difference was chosen, according to accessibility standards, in order to make the acryonym apparent to those with visiual accessibility issues.  

Though beyond the scope of this project, more could be done with colour for accessibility, though by and large the contrast protocols for the AA accessibility standard have been met.  The largest image on the page is technically speaking not an image but a background, which makes it unable to carry an alt attribute.  There would be a way of designing this page differently that would permit accessibility captioning. Furthermore the page code should make more use of relative values in sizing so that the page will load properly on all devices. Finally, the content sections could also be more clearly written for ease of understanding by those who may run businesses but not have technical vocabulary in the field of business or management.  I would be happy to work with Horiseon toward these and perhaps other objectives under a new contract.

Karla Wubbenhorst was the sole creator of this accessibility enhancement of the Horiseon company's exisiting webpage.  The original webpage was developed by Xamder Rapstine of Austin Texas http://www.rapstine.com, and George Yoo of Winter Springs, Florida https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-yoo/.  Web resources such as Stack Overflow and Mozilla Developer Network were consulted for help with topics such as how to format the header with navbar inline with h1, the current HTML 5 conventions re: the non-semantic element span, and the use of aria properties to render emojis intelligible by screen readers.
